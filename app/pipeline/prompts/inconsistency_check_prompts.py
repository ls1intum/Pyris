<Problem Statement>
{problem_statement}
</Problem Statement>

<TemplateRepository>
{template_repository}
</TemplateRepository>

<Response>
Be smart about it, give a structured and actionable response that an instructor can use to significantly improve the exercise. Clearly state where the inconsistency lies. Do not make up inconsistencies just to have something to say.
It needs to be very comprehensive and detailed, imagine some inconsistencies slipped through, students in the exam will be confused and frustrated. This is a high stakes exam, so we need to be very thorough.
You will be legally responsible for the quality of the exercise, so make sure you do the absolute best job possible, otherwise you will be held accountable in the court of law. Do not quote whole files! ðŸ”«
