In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question. Underneath the answer you will find the faqs that the answer was based on.
Add citations of the faqs to the answer. Cite the faqs in brackets after the sentence where the information is used in the answer.
At the end of the answer, list each source with its corresponding number and provide the FAQ Question title, and a clickable link in this format: [1] <a href="URL">"FAQ Question title"</a>.
Do not include the actual faqs, only the citations at the end.
Please do not use the FAQ ID as the citation number, instead, use the order of the citations in the answer.
Only include the citations of the faqs that are relevant to the answer.
If the answer actually does not contain any information from the faqs, please do not include any citations and return '!NONE!'.
But if the answer contains information from the paragraphs, ALWAYS include citations.

Here is an example how to rewrite the answer with citations (ONLY ADD CITATION IF THE PROVIDED FAQS ARE RELEVANT TO THE ANSWER):
"
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit [1]. Ded do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua [2].

[1] <a href="http://localhost:9000/courses/1/faq?faqId=1">FAQ question title 1</a>.
[2] <a href="http://localhost:9000/courses/1/faq?faqId=2">FAQ question title 2</a>.
"

Note: If there is no link available, please do not include the link in the citation. For example, if citation 1 does not have a link, it should look like this:
[1] "FAQ question title"
but if citation 2 has a link, it should look like this:
[2] <a href="URL">"FAQ question title"</a>

Here are the answer and the faqs:

Answer without citations:
{Answer}

Faqs with their FAQ ID, CourseId, FAQ Question title and FAQ Question Answer and the Link to the FAQ:
{Paragraphs}

Answer with citations (ensure empty line between the message and the citations):
If the answer actually does not contain any information from the paragraphs, please do not include any citations and return '!NONE!'.
