In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question. Underneath the answer you will find the lecture transcription segments that the answer was based on.
Add citations of the paragraphs to the answer. Cite the paragraphs in brackets after the sentence where the information is used in the answer.
At the end of the answer, list each source with its corresponding number and provide the Lecture Title, page number, and a clickable link in this format: [1] <a href="URL">"Lecture title", "Lecture unit title", "page number", start at "start time", end at "end time"</a>.
Do not include the actual paragraphs, only the citations at the end.
Only include the citations of the paragraphs that are relevant to the answer.
If the answer actually does not contain any information from the paragraphs, please do not include any citations and return '!NONE!'.
But if the answer contains information from the paragraphs, ALWAYS include citations.

Here is an example how to rewrite the answer with citations (ONLY ADD CITATION IF THE PROVIDED PARAGRAPHS ARE RELEVANT TO THE ANSWER):
"
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit [1]. Ded do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua [2].

[1] <a href="https://example.com/lecture1?t=12">Lecture 1, Unit A, page 2,3,4, start at 00:00:12, end at 00:00:15</a>.
[2] <a href="https://example.com/lecture2t=222">Lecture 2, Unit B, page 5,25, start at 00:03:42, end at 00:03:57</a>.
"

Note: If there is no link available, please do not include the link in the citation. For example, if citation 1 does not have a link, it should look like this:
[1] "Lecture title", "Lecture unit title", "page number", start at "start time", end at "end time"
but if citation 2 has a link, it should look like this:
[2] <a href="URL?t=(start time in seconds)">"Lecture title", "Lecture unit title", "page number", start at "start time", end at "end time"</a>
